# Weather Journal App Project

## Description
This project creates an asynchronous web application that uses a Web API and user input data to dynamically update the UI.

## Features
- Setup a local server with GET and POST routes
- Used the Fetch API with my credentials and user input (acquired from OpenWeatherMap API mentioned below) to get dynamic data into my app routes
- The App takes a zip code and user-input content and returns the current date and weather with the aforementioned  content.


## Dependencies
For this project, I installed Node.js, and a couple of JSON packages like Express and CORS, all of which are included in the repo.
As for the OpenWeatherMap API, all I did was sign up at this [link](https://openweathermap.org) and got my personalized API Key along with my base url, all information can be found in this [documentation](https://openweathermap.org/current)
